# Blazor.FileSystemAccess
A Blazor wrapper for the JavaScript API [File System Access](https://wicg.github.io/file-system-access)

The API makes it possible to read and write to your local file system from the browser both files and directories.

This wrapper has for now wrapped the basic parts of the API which covers opening existing files and creating new files.
