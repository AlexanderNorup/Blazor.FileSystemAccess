# Blazor.FileSystemAccess
A Blazor wrapper for the browser API [File System Access](https://wicg.github.io/file-system-access)

The API makes it possible to read and write to your local file system from the browser both files and directories. The API is supported on a limited set of browsers. Most noticeable not supported on Chrome for Android phones yet.

This wrapper has for now wrapped the basic parts of the API which covers opening existing files, creating new files, and opening directories.
